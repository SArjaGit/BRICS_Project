# BRICS Performance Indicators Analysis 
  This Project is to visualize, compare, and understand the development of emerging economies related to Economic, Education and Environment, Health and Poverty and Private Sector for BRICS countries. We will be standardizing and updating the insightful data from the World Bank, it allows for better analysis and insights into each country’s economy.

## Following are the analysed areas and their observations:

  * ### Economic Data:
     * **Adjusted net national income (annual % growth)** - 
            Adjusted net national income (annual % growth) measures the annual percentage growth rate of a country’s adjusted net national income (NNI). This metric provides a more comprehensive view of national income by accounting for the depreciation of fixed capital and the depletion of natural resources

         ***Observation*** - The Chinese Adjusted net national income increased rapidly from 2012 compared with rest of the countries.

     * **Adjusted net national income per capita** -
            Adjusted net national income per capita is a measure that reflects the average income per person in a country, adjusted for the depreciation of fixed capital and the depletion of natural resources. This metric provides a more accurate representation of sustainable income by accounting for the wear and tear on capital assets and the reduction of natural resources.

         ***Observation*** - Brazil and Russian average income per person reduced from 2013 and for the rest of the countires its slowly increasing over the years.

     * **Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added** -
            Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added refers to the net output of these sectors after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. This metric is crucial for understanding the economic contribution of these primary sectors to a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

         ***Observation*** - Russia has a lowest Economic contribution from Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing during 2010 and highest at 2011
                             South Africa has a lowest Economic contribution from Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing during 2016 and highest at 2017
                             India has a lowest Economic contribution from Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing during 2009 and highest at 2010
                             Brazil has a lowest Economic contribution from Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing during 2016 and highest at 2017
                             China is having almost constant Economic contribution from Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing

      * **GDP (constant 2010 US$)** - 
            GDP (constant 2010 US$) is a measure of a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) adjusted for inflation, using the year 2010 as the base year. This metric allows for the comparison of economic output over time by removing the effects of price changes.

         ***Observation*** - The Chinese Gross Domestic Product adjusted for inflation increased rapidly compared with rest of the countries which are almost constant  through out the years.
     
  * ### Education and Environment Data:
     * Access to electricity
     * Agricultural land
     * Children out of school, primary, male
     * **such as**
  * ### Health and Poverty Data: 
     * Birth Rate
     * Cause of Death
     * Immunization
     * Current Health Expenditure
     * **such as**
  * ### Private Sector Data:
     * **Agricultural raw materials exports (% of merchandise exports)** - 
            Agricultural raw materials exports refer to the export of unprocessed or minimally processed materials derived from agriculture. These materials are essential for various industries and include items such as raw cotton, wool, hides, skins, and other crude materials (excluding fuels).

         ***Observation*** - Minimally Processed Material exports is almost same for every country except for Brazil it increased over the last 5 years.

     * **Binding coverage, all products (%)** - 
            Binding coverage refers to the percentage of tariff lines or products for which a country has committed to a maximum tariff rate, known as a bound rate, under the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements. This commitment means that the country cannot increase tariffs above the bound rate without negotiating with its trading partners and potentially offering compensation.

         ***Observation*** - Binding Coverage is constant across all the years for most of the countries.No Data available for Brazil and China.

     * **Commercial service imports (current US$)** - 
            Commercial service imports refer to the total value of services imported by a country, excluding government services not included elsewhere. These services can include a wide range of activities such as transportation, travel, financial services, insurance, telecommunications, and business services

         ***Observation*** - Commercial Service Imports increased a lot for China compared with Rest of the countries.
            For Brazil and South Africa the Commercial service Imports have not increased and are almost same across the years.

     * **Import value index (2000 = 100)** - 
            This is a measure used to track changes in the value of a country’s imports over time, using the year 2000 as the base year (index value of 100). This index helps to understand how the value of imports has evolved, taking into account factors like price changes and currency fluctuations

         ***Observation*** - The Countries imports over time have decresed for all the countries during 2014 - 2016 and started to increase from 2016 onwards 

     * **International tourism, expenditures (current US$)** - 
            International tourism expenditures refer to the total amount of money spent by residents of a country on travel and tourism-related activities abroad. This includes expenses on accommodation, food, transportation, entertainment, and other services while traveling internationally.

         ***Observation*** - The chinese tourism expenditure have grown drastically from 2012 compared with rest of the countries
